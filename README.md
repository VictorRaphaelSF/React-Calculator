# React-Calculator
This project signifies the realization of a web calculator using the React library, developed as part of the Web Programming III course at Etec Doutora Ruth Cardoso. The endeavor not only showcases my proficiency in implementing solutions using modern technologies like React but also serves as a deliberate test of my skills. By undertaking this challenge, I aimed not only to meet the course requirements but also to explore and enhance my capabilities as a developer. The project reflects my commitment to excellence in software development and the practical application of the knowledge gained during my education.
